In this file we will be using JavaScript and jQuery to add functionality to the
webpage. We will also be using the Bootstrap Framework as well.

Keep in mind that we have to attach the library of JQuery prior to the Js files
such that if we use jquery, it will be reflected in the script files. If done
vice versa, meaning Jquery library follows the js files, than this will not
function effectively.

Same rule applies to the Bootstrap Framework, we need to attach the framework
library prior to styles.css but after reset.css. As reset.css, resets the whole webpage.

Icons and Fonts and always be placed prior to the reset.css and this will not
effect them.

All this is being done on index.html.

Also, all script tags should be placed at the end of the code towards the end of the
body tag such that the webpage can load faster.
